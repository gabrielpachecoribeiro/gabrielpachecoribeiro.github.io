This poster was presented at "Workshop on Classical Gravity and Applications", an event organized by ICTP-SAIFR that ocurred at IFT, Unesp. The poster was based on some previous work done, and presents a method for mapping f(R) theories of gravity developed in the Palatini formalism into General Relativity. This method can be of great use for simplifying computational and mathematical work.
