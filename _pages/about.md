### Hi there! My name is Caio Tomás. <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">

I am currently an undergraduate student of Mathematics at the University of Brasília and a Data Science intern at IBPAD - Instituto Brasileiro de Pesquisa e Análise de Dados. 

I'm really passionated about math and science. If you let me, I'll speak hours non stop about these topics!

Current and previous work
======

- 🔭🧲 I'm currently on a research project on the compression of a granular layer composed of repelling magnetic particles, under the orientation of professor Yuri Dumaresq Sobral (here's his [curriculum Lattes](http://lattes.cnpq.br/2148849606092346), [ResearchGate profile](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yuri-Sobral) and [website](http://yuri.mat.unb.br/)).

- 🤝🏼  I’m looking to collaborate on anything that involves at least a little bit of math!

- I have also done other research projects while an undergrad at UnB. You can check them in detail at my [curriculum Lattes](http://lattes.cnpq.br/3803046005556999). Here is the list of them, with the topics of research resumed for the sake of brevity and ordered older to recent:

  - I did a PIBIC (*Institutional Program of Scientific Initiation Scholarships*, in free translation) on **Knot and Braid Theory** under the orientation of professor Sheila Campos Chagas (here's her [curriculum Lattes](http://lattes.cnpq.br/3851790594023130) and [website](https://www.mat.unb.br/~sheila/)) (August 2019 - September 2020);
  
  - I did a research on **Projective Geometry** under the orientation of professor Lucas Conque Seco Ferreira (here's his [curriculum Lattes](http://lattes.cnpq.br/9312332483222873)) (September 2020 - November 2020);
  
  - I did another research under the orientation of professor Lucas on **The 3 constant curvature geometries as subgeometries of the Projective Geometry**, collaborating with my colleague and friend, Matheus de Freitas Souza (here's his [curriculum Lattes](http://lattes.cnpq.br/1097350416973041)) (January 2021 - May 2021);
  
  - More recently, I did a research on **The formalism of Special Relativity**, under the orientation of professor Luciana Maria Dias de Ávila Rodrigues (here's her [curriculum Lattes](http://lattes.cnpq.br/6564647402919278)) (June 2021 - November 2021);
