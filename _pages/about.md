### Hi there! My name is Gabriel Ribeiro. <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">

I am currently a masters student of Physics at the Federal University of Par√°. 

Current and previous work
======

- I'm currently working on modified gravity and it's applications under the orientation of professor Lu√≠s Carlos Bassalo Crispino (here's his [curriculum Lattes](http://lattes.cnpq.br/4033994493756291) and [google scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=Q0R_iqQAAAAJ&hl=en)) and professor Gonzalo J. Olmo (here's his [ResearchGate profile](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Gonzalo-Olmo), [google scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oqZg53cAAAAJ) and [website](https://www.uv.es/olalgon/publico/CV.html)). 


- ü§ùüèº  I‚Äôm looking foward to collaborate on anything that involves at least a little bit of physics and math!
